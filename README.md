# LiveSplit.IGT

LiveSplit.IGT is a LiveSplit component for keeping track of parallel timers within games that run at different rates from real time. It can be used entirely as a standalone component, or it can integrate with the LiveSplit IGT Client to send MARK commands to re-synchronize the timer mid-run.
